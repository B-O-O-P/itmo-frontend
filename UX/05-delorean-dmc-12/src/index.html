              De&shy;ment&shy;ors have been spot&shy;ted at an alarm&shy;ing rate in the last

              Ma&shy;gic&shy;al Creatures are just as baffled by their sur&shy;pris&shy;ing

              were spot&shy;ted near The Leaky Cauldron in Lon&shy;don, and two were seen in
              Knock&shy;turn Al&shy;ley over the week&shy;end. Res&shy;id&shy;ents as far as
              Kent have also re&shy;por&shy;ted de&shy;ment&shy;or sight&shy;ings. As most of our
              read&shy;ers know, de&shy;ment&shy;ors were
              re&shy;moved from their em&shy;ploy at Azkaban Pris&shy;on after the second
              wiz&shy;ard&shy;ing war after their al&shy;le&shy;gi&shy;ances changed and they began

                  Siri&shy;us was ar&shy;res&shy;ted by the De&shy;part&shy;ment of
                  Ma&shy;gic&shy;al Law En&shy;force&shy;ment and sen&shy;tenced by

                  where&shy;abouts which lead to their death and ser&shy;vice to Lord
                  Vol&shy;de&shy;mort. The sur&shy;viv&shy;ing Muggles were Ob&shy;livi&shy;ated
                  and giv&shy;en an ex&shy;cuse by the Muggle-Worthy Ex&shy;cuse Com&shy;mit&shy;tee
                  that a gas-leak oc&shy;curred be&shy;fore they could re&shy;mem&shy;ber who really
                  cast the Blast&shy;ing Curse. Pet&shy;ti&shy;grew was un&shy;justly awar&shy;ded
                  the Or&shy;der of Merlin, First Class for his con&shy;front&shy;a&shy;tion with
                  Siri&shy;us, which, along with the fin&shy;ger that they re&shy;covered, were
                  &quot;posthum&shy;ously&quot; giv&shy;en to his moth&shy;er. As the time passed,
                  due to mis&shy;con&shy;cep&shy;tions, many be&shy;lieved that Black drew his wand
                  and killed Pet&shy;ti&shy;grew be&shy;fore the oth&shy;er had
                  a chance of even draw&shy;ing. Even the oth&shy;er re&shy;main&shy;ing
                  Ma&shy;raud&shy;er, Re&shy;mus, be&shy;lieved it was Siri&shy;us who be&shy;trayed
                  their broth&shy;er&shy;hood. Marked as Pris&shy;on&shy;er ·õà·õâ-390, Siri&shy;us was
                  placed in sol&shy;it&shy;ary con&shy;fine&shy;ment at the mercy of the Azkaban
                  guards, the De&shy;ment&shy;ors. Driv&shy;en to the brink of
                  mad&shy;ness, he re&shy;tained his san&shy;ity by fo&shy;cus&shy;ing on his
                  in&shy;no&shy;cence, which he said in the Shriek&shy;ing Shack was &quot;more an
                  ob&shy;ses&shy;sion than a happy thought&quot;; it could not be de&shy;tec&shy;ted
                  by the De&shy;ment&shy;ors, but still al&shy;lowed him to main&shy;tain a sense of
                  self and re&shy;gain enough strength to trans&shy;form in&shy;to his An&shy;imagus
                  form in his cell. Since De&shy;ment&shy;ors have dif&shy;fi&shy;culty sens&shy;ing
                  the less com&shy;plex emo&shy;tions of an&shy;im&shy;als, he was able to re&shy;
                  main re&shy;l&shy;at&shy;ively un&shy;af&shy;fected as a dog. It was not at all
                  trouble to them, though, since they thought it meant he was los&shy;ing his mind
                  like every oth&shy;er con&shy;vict in their cus&shy;tody, in&shy;clud&shy;ing
                  Bel&shy;lat&shy;rix and some of her fel&shy;low Death Eat&shy;ers.

                    As a mis&shy;guided at&shy;tempt to pro&shy;tect the stu&shy;dents, Fudge
                    pos&shy;ted De&shy;ment&shy;ors around the school, which nearly pro&shy;duced
                    tra&shy;gic res&shy;ults. The teach&shy;ers, as well as Madam Ros&shy;merta in
                    Hogs&shy;meade, found the creatures' pres&shy;ence dis&shy;tract&shy;ing and
                    highly un&shy;pleas&shy;ant, and Harry was a fre&shy;quent tar&shy;get
                    of the De&shy;ment&shy;ors' ac&shy;tions. In Oc&shy;to&shy;ber, Fudge was
                    aler&shy;ted to Black's entry in&shy;to Hog&shy;warts on Hal&shy;lowe'en night.
                    Con&shy;vinced Black was hid&shy;ing eith&shy;er in or around Hogs&shy;meade,
                    Fudge had the De&shy;ment&shy;ors search the area, call&shy;ing it a
                    ne&shy;ces&shy;sary pre&shy;cau&shy;tion. In Decem&shy;ber, he jour&shy;neyed
                    to the school, and stopped at the Three Broom&shy;sticks with
                    Pro&shy;fess&shy;ors McGon&shy;agall, Fl&shy;itwick, and Hag&shy;rid.
                    In&shy;vit&shy;ing Ros&shy;merta to join them, Fudge pro&shy;ceeded to
                    ex&shy;plain Black's con&shy;nec&shy;tion to Harry Pot&shy;ter, and that all
                    evid&shy;ence poin&shy;ted out that Black told Vol&shy;de&shy;mort where
                    the Pot&shy;ters were hid&shy;den al&shy;most a week after he was
                    ap&shy;poin&shy;ted their Secret-Keeper. Fudge then ad&shy;mit&shy;ted that
                    he be&shy;lieved Black's even&shy;tu&shy;al plan was to find Vol&shy;de&shy;mort
                    and re&shy;turn him to power. After this, Fudge left the pub for a meet&shy;ing
                    with Dumble&shy;dore. Un&shy;be&shy;knownst to him, Harry Pot&shy;ter
                    over&shy;heard this con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion and was greatly af&shy;fected
                    by it, hop&shy;ing for the op&shy;por&shy;tun&shy;ity to kill Black.

                  Siri&shy;us Black, the most in&shy;fam&shy;ous pris&shy;on&shy;er from Azkaban,
                  has been sighted in Dufftown by an as&shy;tute Muggle. The Muggles think that he
                  is just an or&shy;dinaty crim&shy;in&shy;al, they don't have a clue how
                  dan&shy;gerous, power&shy;ful and vin&shy;dict&shy;ive Black can be.

                  <br/>The situ&shy;a&shy;tion got worse when hundreds of De&shy;ment&shy;ors
                  turned up mak&shy;ing the small Dufftown pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion quiver in
                  pan&shy;ic. It took more than 4 hours for the Spe&shy;ci&shy;al Force to
                  tran&shy;quil&shy;l&shy;ize what was a great shock for the muggles. Siri&shy;us
                  Black es&shy;caped from Azkaban Pris&shy;on last sum&shy;mer and has been at large
                  since then. The Min&shy;is&shy;ter of Ma&shy;gic, Cor&shy;neli&shy;us
                  Fudge, has already asked to all the Wiz&shy;ards to be really care&shy;ful
                  and act with cau&shy;tion and to not at&shy;tempt to use ma&shy;gic against him.
                  The Min&shy;is&shy;ter only asks to no&shy;ti&shy;fy im&shy;me&shy;di&shy;ately
